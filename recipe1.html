        A Mango Fool is a simple, delicious dessert that combines sweet mango with whipped cream for a light and refreshing treat.
        
       <br>
       <br>

        Ingredients
        2 large ripe mangoes (peeled, pitted, and diced)
        <br>
        <br>
        2-3 tablespoons granulated sugar (adjust based on mango sweetness)
        <br>
        <br>
        1 teaspoon fresh lemon or lime juice
        <br>
        <br>
        1 cup heavy cream (chilled)
        <br>
        <br>
        1 teaspoon vanilla extract
        <br>
        <br>
        Optional: Mint leaves or diced mango for garnish
        <br>
        <br>
        Instructions
        <br><br>
        Prepare the Mango Puree
        <br><br>
        Place the diced mangoes, sugar, and lemon/lime juice in a blender or food processor.
        <br><br>
        Blend until smooth. Taste and adjust sugar if needed.
        <br><br>
        Chill the puree in the refrigerator for about 15-20 minutes.
        <br><br>
        Whip the Cream
        <br>
        <br>
        
        In a large bowl, whisk the chilled heavy cream and vanilla extract until soft peaks form.
        <br><br>
        Be careful not to overwhip; the cream should be light and airy.
        <br><br>
        Assemble the Mango Fool
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        
        Gently fold about 2/3 of the mango puree into the whipped cream, leaving streaks for a marbled effect (or fully combine for a uniform look).
        Layer the remaining mango puree and the whipped mixture into serving glasses or bowls.
        Chill & Serve
        <br>
        <br>

        
        Refrigerate the assembled Mango Fool for at least 30 minutes to let the flavors meld.
        <br><br>
        Garnish with mint leaves or small pieces of diced mango before serving.
        <br><br>
        Tips
        <br>
        Mango Variety:
        <br><br>
         Alphonso or Ataulfo mangoes work best due to their natural sweetness and flavor.
         <br>
        Add Texture:
        <br><br>
         Include a layer of crushed cookies or biscuit crumbs for a crunch.
         <br>
        Dairy-Free Option: Replace whipped cream with coconut cream for a vegan-friendly version.
        <br><br>
        Enjoy your light and luscious Mango Fool!</p>
