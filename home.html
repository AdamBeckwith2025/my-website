    <p class="text">"For over 18 years, I have dedicated my life to the art of cooking, honing my craft under some of the most iconic names in the culinary world. My journey began with a dream of creating exceptional dishes, and I’ve been fortunate enough to work alongside renowned chefs like Gordon Ramsay, Jamie Oliver, and Tom Kitchin at his Michelin-starred restaurant. I’ve also had the privilege of serving as a chef at Manchester United Football Club, where I crafted meals for world-class athletes.

        My philosophy is simple: every dish should tell a story, combining creativity, technique, and the finest ingredients to create unforgettable moments."</p>
