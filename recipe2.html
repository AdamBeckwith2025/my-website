        Crispy Stuffed Bone Marrow
        Ingredients:
        
        4 large beef marrow bones (cut lengthwise)
        <br>
        <br>

        1 cup panko breadcrumbs
        <br>
        <br>

        2 tbsp parsley, finely chopped
<br>
<br>
        1 clove garlic, minced
        <br>
        <br>
        Zest of 1 lemon
        <br>
        <br>
        2 tbsp grated Parmesan
        <br>
        <br>

        2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
        <br>
        <br>

        Salt and pepper to taste
        <br><br>
        Instructions:
        <br><br>
        
        Prep the marrow bones:
        <br><br>
        Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Soak the marrow bones in cold water for 1-2 hours to remove blood and impurities, changing the water periodically. Pat dry.
        <br>
        Roast the marrow bones:
        <br><br>
        Place the bones on a foil-lined baking sheet, cut side up. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast for 15-20 minutes, or until the marrow is soft but not completely melted.
        <br>
        Make the stuffing:
        <br><br>
        In a bowl, mix breadcrumbs, parsley, garlic, lemon zest, Parmesan, and melted butter. Season with salt and pepper.
        <br>
        Stuff and crisp:
        <br><br>
        Remove the bones from the oven. Carefully spoon some of the marrow into the breadcrumb mixture, combining gently.
        Pack the mixture on top of the roasted bones, forming a crust. Return to the oven and broil for 2-3 minutes until golden and crispy.
        <br><br>
        Serve:
        <br><br>
        Garnish with fresh parsley and serve with toasted sourdough bread.</P>
